Include details about (1) when it was started, (2) why it was started, (3) what it was designed to address in society. If the program hasn’t started yet, explain why it’s under consideration. Make sure you cite your sources appropriately! (In the past, some students have just copied/pasted text from a program’s website; don’t do that! Describe and analyze the program’s background!)\n\n\n2: Program theory\n(≈400 words)\nExplain and explore the program’s underlying theory. Sometimes programs will explain why they exist in a mission statement, but often they don’t and you have to infer the theory from what the program looks like when implemented. What did the program designers plan on occurring? Was this theory based on existing research? If so, cite it.\nInclude a simple impact theory graph showing the program’s basic activities and outcomes. Recall from class and your reading that this is focused primarily on the theory and mechanisms, not on the implementation of the program.\n\n\n3: Logic model\nList every possible input, activity, output, and outcome for the program and provide a brief 1–2 sentence description of each.\n\nInputs\n\nSomething\nSomething else\n\n\n\nActivities\n\nSomething\nSomething else\n\n\n\nOutputs\n\nSomething\nSomething else\n\n\n\nOutcomes\n\nSomething\nSomething else\n\n\n\nDiagram\nUse flowchart software to connect the inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes and create a complete logic model. Remember that inputs will always feed into activities, and that activities always produce outputs (that’s the whole purpose of an activity: convert an input to an output). Include this as a figure.\n\n\n\n4: Analysis\n(≈150 words)\nEvaluate how well the logic model relates to the program theory. Do the inputs, activities, and outputs have a logical, well-grounded connection to the intended outcomes? Under ideal conditions, would the components of the program lead to changes or lasting effects?"

Pick whichever two seem the most interesting to you:\n\nThe effect of conditional cash transfers on education in Mexico (Box 4.2, p. 70)\n\nOriginal study: (Schultz 2004)\n\nThe impact of Sesame Street on school readiness (Box 5.1, p. 91)\n\nOriginal study: (Kearney and Levine 2015)\n\nThe effects of police deployment on crime in Argentina (Box 7.2, p. 135)\n\nOriginal study: (Di Tella and Schargrodsky 2004)\n\nEarly childhood development and migration in Jamaica (Box 9.5, p. 170)\n\nOriginal study: (Gertler et al. 2014)\n\n\nFor each of the two studies you choose, do the following:\n\nGo through the 13 types of internal validity and describe in 2–3 sentences how the study succeeds/fails to address each concern. Calculate a total internal validity score.\nDescribe any threats to external validity and assess how generalizable the findings are. (≈75 words)\nDescribe any threats to construct validity and assess if the researchers are measuring the thing they intended to measure. (≈75 words)"

    "text": "Evaluation research is tricky and costly. If you begin an intervention or launch a study prematurely, you can waste time and money—and potentially lives.\nEven if you have a well designed program with an impeccable logic model and a perfect DAG, you might discover (too late!) that you forgot to collect some critical variables or realize that your identification strategy will not work.\nFrom a more cynical perspective, you might (unethically) engage in the practice of p-hacking—running all sorts of different model specifications until you find the results you want, and then claim in your report that you had intended to run that model all along.\nOne increasingly popular method for (1) ensuring that your data and methods work before launching a study or intervention, and (2) declaring and committing to your hypotheses and methods and models before analyzing your data is to pre-register your research or evaluation. A pre-registered study contains all the background work—an introduction, literature review, theory, hypotheses, and proposed analysis—but without the actual data. Authors post their expectations and hypotheses publicly so they can be held publicly accountable for any deviations from their proposed design.1\nThe best preregistered studies use simulated data that has the same structure as the data that will be collected (i.e. same columns, sometimes the same correlations and relationships researchers expect to see in the collected data, etc.). Because there’s no data yet (or just fake data), you have more freedom when developing a preregistered study. You can experiment with different models, play with different approaches, manipulate data in different ways, and so on. If you realize that you need a new variable, or that you need to rearrange questions on a survey, or make any other kinds of changes, you can—you haven’t collected the data yet!\n(Additionally, using synthetic data is extremely useful if you’re working with proprietary or private data that you cannot make public. You can make a synthetic version of the real data instead; see this too.)\nOnce you finalize your plan and know all the data you need to collect, and once you’ve written out the different models you’ll run, all you have to do is collect the real data, plop it into your script (replacing the fake data you’d been using), and run the analysis script again to generate the actual, real results. In the results section, you get to either say “As predicted, we found…”, or “Contrary to expectations, we found that…”.\nFor your final project in this class, you will write a pre-registered analysis of a public or nonprofit social program that you’re interested in. You don’t need to worry about collecting data—you’ll create a synthetic dataset for your pre-analysis.\nYou will submit three things via iCollege:\nThis project is due by 11:59 PM on Monday, May 2, 2022.  No late work will be accepted.\nYou can either run the analysis in RStudio locally on your computer (highly recommended(!!), since you won’t have to worry about keeping all your work on RStudio’s servers), or use an RStudio.cloud project. You can make a copy of this RStudio.cloud project—it doesn’t have anything in it, but I have preinstalled all the packages we’ve used over the course of the semester, so you don’t have to."

Please don’t just copy/paste those assignments as is into this final project—you’ll want to polish it up for this final report. You can download this as an RMarkdown file and change the text if you want. I’ve also included this as an RMarkdown file in the empty RStudio.cloud project.\n\n final-project-template.Rmd\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nDescribe the motivation for this evaluation, briefly describe the program to be evaluated, and explain why it matters for society. (≈150 words)\n\n\nProgram overview\nProvide in-depth background about the program. Include details about (1) when it was started, (2) why it was started, (3) what it was designed to address in society. If the program hasn’t started yet, explain why it’s under consideration. (≈300 words)\n\n\nProgram theory and implementation\n\nProgram theory and impact theory graph\nExplain and explore the program’s underlying theory. Sometimes programs will explain why they exist in a mission statement, but often they don’t and you have to infer the theory from what the program looks like when implemented. What did the program designers plan on occurring? Was this theory based on existing research? If so, cite it. (≈300 words)\nInclude a simple impact theory graph showing the program’s basic activities and outcomes. Recall from class and your reading that this is focused primarily on the theory and mechanisms, not on the implementation of the program.\n\n\nLogic model\nDescribe the program’s inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes. Pay careful attention to how they are linked—remember that every input needs to flow into an activity and every output must flow out of an activity. (≈150 words)\nUse flowchart software to connect the inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes and create a complete logic model. Include this as a figure.\n\n\n\nOutcome and causation\n\nMain outcome\nSelect one of the program’s outcomes to evaluate. Explain why you’ve chosen this (is it the most important? easiest to measure? has the greatest impact on society?) (≈50 words)\n\n\nMeasurement\nUsing the concept of the “ladder of abstraction” that we discussed in class (e.g. identifying a witch, measuring poverty, etc.), make a list of all the possible attributes of the outcome. Narrow this list down to 3-4 key attributes. Discuss how you decided to narrow the concepts and justify why you think these attributes capture the outcome. Then, for each of these attributes, answer these questions:\n\nMeasurable definition: How would you specifically define this attribute? (i.e. if the attribute is “reduced crime”, define it as “The percent change in crime in a specific neighborhood during a certain time frame” or something similar)\nIdeal measurement: How would you measure this attribute in an ideal world?\nFeasible measurement: How would you measure this given reality and given limitations in budget, time, etc.?\nMeasurement of program effect: How would to connect this measure to people in the program? How would you check to see if the program itself had an effect?\n\n(≈150 words in this section)\n\n\nCausal theory\nGiven your measurement approach, describe and draw a causal diagram (DAG) that shows how your program causes the outcome. Note that this is not the same thing as the logic model—you’ll likely have nodes in the DAG that aren’t related to the program at all (like socioeconomic status, gender, experience, or other factors). The logic model provides the framework for the actual implementation of your program and connects all the moving parts to the outcomes. The DAG is how you can prove causation with statistical approaches. (≈150 words)\n\n\nHypotheses\nMake predictions of your program’s effect. Declare what you think will happen. (≈50 words)\n\n\n\nData and methods\n\nIdentification strategy\nHow will you measure the actual program effect? Will you rely on an RCT? Differences-in-differences? Regression discontinuity? Instrumental variables? How does your approach account for selection bias and endogeneity? How does your approach isolate the causal effect of the program on the outcome?\nAlso briefly describe what kinds of threats to internal and external validity you face in your study.\n(≈300 words)\n\n\nData\nGiven your measurement approach, limits on feasibility, and identification strategy, describe the data you will use. Will you rely on administrative data collected by a government agency or nonprofit? Will you collect your own data? If so, what variables will you measure, and how? Will you conduct a survey or rely on outside observers or do something else? What does this data look like? What variables does it (or should it) include?\n(≈100 words)\n\n\n\nSynthetic analysis\nGenerate a synthetic (fake) dataset in R with all the variables you’ll need for the real life analysis. Analyze the data using your identification strategy. For instance:\n\nIf you’re relying on observational data, close all the backdoors with matching or inverse probability weighting, don’t adjust for colliders, and make a strong argument for isolation of the causal effect in the absence of treatment/control groups\nIf you’re doing an RCT, test the differences in means in the treatment and control groups (and follow all other best practices listed in the World Bank book, checking for balance across groups, etc.)\nIf you’re doing diff-in-diff, run a regression model with an interaction term to show the diff-in-diff\nIf you’re doing regression discontinuity, check for a jump in the outcome variable at the cutoff in the running variable\nIf you’re using instrumental variables, check the validity of your instrument and run a 2SLS model\n\nInclude robustness checks to ensure the validity of your effect (i.e. if you’re doing regression discontinuity, test different bandwidths and kernel types; etc.)\n(As many words as you need to fully describe your analysis and results)\n\n\nConclusion\nWhat would the findings from this analysis mean for your selected program? What would it mean if you found an effect? What would it mean if you didn’t find an effect? Why does any of this matter? (≈75 words)"

Because the content in thsi course is flipped, these questions are crucial for our weekly in-class discussions.\nTo encourage engagement with the course content—and to allow me to collect the class’s questions each week—you’ll need to fill out a short response on iCollege. This should be ≈150 words. That’s fairly short: there are ≈250 words on a typical double-spaced page in Microsoft Word (500 when single-spaced).\nThese check-ins are due by noon on the days we have class. This is so I can look through the responses and start structuring the discussion for the evening’s class.\nYou should answer these two questions each week:\n\nWhat were the three (3) most interesting or exciting things you learned from the session? Why?\nWhat were the three (3) muddiest or unclear things from the session this week? What are you still wondering about?\n\nYou can include more than three interesting or muddiest things, but you must include at least three. There should be six easily identifiable things in each check-in: three exciting things and three questions.\nI will grade these check-ins using a check system:\n\n✔+: (11.5 points (115%) in gradebook) Response shows phenomenal thought and engagement with the course content. I will not assign these often.\n✔: (10 points (100%) in gradebook) Response is thoughtful, well-written, and shows engagement with the course content. This is the expected level of performance.\n✔−: (5 points (50%) in gradebook) Response is hastily composed, too short, and/or only cursorily engages with the course content. This grade signals that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often.\n\nNotice that is essentially a pass/fail or completion-based system. I’m not grading your writing ability, I’m not counting the exact number of words you’re writing, and I’m not looking for encyclopedic citations of every single reading to prove that you did indeed read everything.

    "text": "RStudio on your computer\nRStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics. Over the course of the semester, you should wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud and install all these things locally. This is also important if you want to customize fonts, since RStudio.cloud has extremely limited support for fonts other than Helvetica.\nHere’s how you install all these things\n\nInstall R\nFirst you need to install R itself (the engine).\n\nGo to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)1 website: https://cran.r-project.org/\nClick on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows:\n::: {.cell} ::: {.cell-output-display}  ::: :::\n\nIf you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files (in this picture, it’s R-4.0.0.pkg; as of right now, the current version is also 4.0.0) and download it.\n::: {.cell} ::: {.cell-output-display}  ::: :::\nIf you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.\n::: {.cell} ::: {.cell-output-display}  ::: :::\n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\nIf you use macOS, download and install XQuartz. You do not need to do this on Windows.\n\n\n\nInstall RStudio\nNext, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\n\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\nThe website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:\n::: {.cell} ::: {.cell-output-display}  ::: :::\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n::: {.cell} ::: {.cell-output-display}  ::: :::\nDouble click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n\nDouble click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n\n\nInstall tidyverse\nR packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including ggplot2) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n\n\nInstall tinytex\nWhen you knit to PDF, R uses a special scientific typesetting program named LaTeX (pronounced “lay-tek” or “lah-tex”; for goofy nerdy reasons, the x is technically the “ch” sound in “Bach”, but most people just say it as “k”—saying “layteks” is frowned on for whatever reason).\nLaTeX is neat and makes pretty documents, but it’s a huge program—the macOS version, for instance, is nearly 4 GB! To make life easier, there’s an R package named tinytex that installs a minimal LaTeX program and that automatically deals with differences between macOS and Windows.\nHere’s how to install tinytex so you can knit to pretty PDFs:\n\nUse the Packages in panel in RStudio to install tinytex like you did above with tidyverse. Alternatively, run install.packages(\"tinytex\") in the console.\nRun tinytex::install_tinytex() in the console.\nWait for a bit while R downloads and installs everything you need.\nThe end! You should now be able to knit to PDF."

It’s fairly short and just has lots of examples of good and bad ways of writing code (naming variables, dealing with long lines, using proper indentation levels, etc.)—you should glance through it some time.\nRStudio has a built-in way of cleaning up your code.

If you submit something like filter(mpg,cty>10,class==\"compact\"), I might recommend adding spaces, but it won’t affect your grade or points or anything.\n\n\nSpacing\n\nSee the “Spacing” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n\nPut spaces after commas (like in regular English):\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg, cty > 10)\n\n# Bad\nfilter(mpg , cty > 10)\nfilter(mpg ,cty > 10)\nfilter(mpg,cty > 10)\n\nPut spaces around operators like +, -, >, =, etc.:\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg, cty > 10)\n\n# Bad\nfilter(mpg, cty>10)\nfilter(mpg, cty> 10)\nfilter(mpg, cty >10)\n\nDon’t put spaces around parentheses that are parts of functions:\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg, cty > 10)\n\n# Bad\nfilter (mpg, cty > 10)\nfilter ( mpg, cty > 10)\nfilter( mpg, cty > 10 )\n\n\n\nLong lines\n\nSee the “Long lines” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n\nIt’s generally good practice to not have really long lines of code. A good suggestion is to keep lines at a maximum of 80 characters. Instead of counting characters by hand (ew), in RStudio go to “Tools” > “Global Options” > “Code” > “Display” and check the box for “Show margin”. You should now see a really thin line indicating 80 characters. Again, you can go beyond this—that’s fine. It’s just good practice to avoid going too far past it.\nYou can add line breaks inside longer lines of code. Line breaks should come after commas, and things like function arguments should align within the function:\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg, cty > 10, class == \"compact\")\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg, cty > 10, \n       class == \"compact\")\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg,\n       cty > 10,\n       class == \"compact\")\n\n# Bad\nfilter(mpg, cty > 10, class %in% c(\"compact\", \"pickup\", \"midsize\", \"subcompact\", \"suv\", \"2seater\", \"minivan\"))\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg, \n       cty > 10, \n       class %in% c(\"compact\", \"pickup\", \"midsize\", \"subcompact\", \n                    \"suv\", \"2seater\", \"minivan\"))\n\n\n\nPipes (%>%) and ggplot layers (+)\nPut each layer of a ggplot plot on separate lines, with the + at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n\n# Good\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n# Bad\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +\n  geom_point() + geom_smooth() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n# Super bad\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw()\n\n# Super bad and won't even work\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class))\n  + geom_point()\n  + geom_smooth() \n  + theme_bw()\n\nPut each step in a dplyr pipeline on separate lines, with the %>% at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n\n# Good\nmpg %>% \n  filter(cty > 10) %>% \n  group_by(class) %>% \n  summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))\n\n# Bad\nmpg %>% filter(cty > 10) %>% group_by(class) %>% \n  summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))\n\n# Super bad\nmpg %>% filter(cty > 10) %>% group_by(class) %>% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))\n\n# Super bad and won't even work\nmpg %>% \n  filter(cty > 10)\n  %>% group_by(class)\n  %>% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))\n\n\n\nComments\n\nSee the “Comments” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n\nComments should start with a comment symbol and a single space: #\n\n# Good\n\n#Bad\n\n    #Bad\n\nIf the comment is really short (and won’t cause you to go over 80 characters in the line), you can include it in the same line as the code, separated by at least two spaces (it works with one space, but using a couple can enhance readability):\n\nmpg %>% \n  filter(cty > 10) %>%  # Only rows where cty is 10 +\n  group_by(class) %>%  # Divide into class groups\n  summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))  # Find the average hwy in each group\n\nYou can add extra spaces to get inline comments to align, if you want:\n\nmpg %>% \n  filter(cty > 10) %>%            # Only rows where cty is 10 +\n  group_by(class) %>%             # Divide into class groups\n  summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))  # Find the average hwy in each group\n\nIf the comment is really long, you can break it into multiple lines. RStudio can do this for you if you go to “Code” > “Reflow comment”\n\n# Good\n# Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\n# Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys’ house.

    "text": "Because RStudio projects typically consist of multiple files (R scripts, datasets, graphical output, etc.) the easiest way to distribute them to you for examples, assignments, and projects is to combine all the different files in to a single compressed collection called a zip file. When you unzip a zipped file, your operating system extracts all the files that are contained inside into a new folder on your computer.\nUnzipping files on macOS is trivial, but unzipping files on Windows can mess you up if you don’t pay careful attention. Here’s a helpful guide to unzipping files on both macOS and Windows."

If you double click on the .zip file, Windows will show you what’s inside, but it will do so without actually extracting anything. This can be is incredibly confusing! Here’s what it looks like—the only clues that this folder is really a .zip file are that there’s a “Compressed Folder Tools” tab at the top, and there’s a “Ratio” column that shows how much each file is compressed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is very tempting to try to open files from this view. However, if you do, things will break and you won’t be able to correctly work with any of the files in the zipped folder. If you open the R Project file, for instance, RStudio will point to a bizarre working directory buried deep in some temporary folder:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou most likely won’t be able to open any data files or save anything, which will be frustrating.\nInstead, you need to right click on the .zip file and select “Extract All…”:\n\n\n\n\n\nThen choose where you want to unzip all the files and click on “Extract”\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should then finally have a real folder with all the contents of the zipped file.

La sección de diseño cubre temas como cuestionarios, muestreo, aplicación y documentación. Esta sección se evaluará con un reporte donde se analice la calidad de alguna encuesta realizada recientemente a nivel nacional, identificando aspectos críticos y sugerencias de mejora. En la segunda parte se trabajará con herramientas de visualización de datos, generación de reportes y presentación de resultados, lo que sera evaluado mediante un documento de reporte de alguna encuesta de interés.\nLa metodología incluye clases lectivas, presentaciones de invitados, y presentación de trabajos grupales."
